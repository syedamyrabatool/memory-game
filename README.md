# Memory Game React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

###Scope: 
Design a memory game, where we flip the cards and try to match the 2 cards opened.
We keep the cards open if they match and the game is finished when all the cards are open.

Number of cards is controlled by App (But can be provided using a Search field)

If game is started with odd number of cards it will throw error message.
